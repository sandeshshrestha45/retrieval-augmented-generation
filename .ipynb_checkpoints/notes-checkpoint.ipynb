    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be roughly broken down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",
    "* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
    "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
    "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
    "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
    "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
    "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
    "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
    "effective at their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can also be a much quicker solution to implement than fine-tuning an LLM on specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What kind of problems can RAG be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can help anywhere there is a specific set of information that an LLM may not have in its training data (e.g. anything not publicly accessible on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
    "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
    "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
    "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
    "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these have the common theme of retrieving relevant resources and then presenting them in an understandable way using an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this angle, you can consider an LLM a calculator for words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why local?\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy, speed, cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running locally means you use your own hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a privacy standpoint, this means you don't have send potentially sensitive data to an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a speed standpoint, it means you won't necessarily have to wait for an API queue or downtime, if your hardware is running, the pipeline can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "And from a cost standpoint, running on your own hardware often has a heavier starting cost but little to no costs after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance wise, LLM APIs may still perform better than an open-source model running locally on general tasks but there are more and more examples appearing of smaller, focused models outperforming larger models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key terms\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Description |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- | \n",
    "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
    "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
    "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
    "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
    "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
    "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
    "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). | "

    "### Chunking and embedding questions\n",
    "#### Which embedding model should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends on many factors. My best advice is to experiment, experiment, experiment!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the model to run locally, you'll have to make sure it's feasible to run on your own hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to see how different models perform on a wide range of embedding tasks is the Hugging Face Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What other forms of text chunking/splitting are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a fair few options here too. We've kept it simple with groups of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more, Pinecone has a great guide on different kinds of chunking including for different kinds of data such as markdown and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as LangChain also have a good amount of in-built text splitting options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What should I think about when creating my embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model turns text inputs up to 384 tokens long in embedding vectors of size 768.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the larger the vector size, the more information that gets encoded into the embedding (however, this is not always the case, as smaller, better models can outperform larger ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though with larger vector sizes comes larger storage and compute requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is also relatively small (420MB) in size compared to larger models that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger models may result in better performance but will also require more compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "So some things to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Size of input - If you need to embed longer sequences, choose a model with a larger input capacity.\n",
    "* Size of embedding vector - Larger is generally a better representation but requires more compute/storage.\n",
    "* Size of model - Larger models generally result in better embeddings but require more compute power/time to run.\n",
    "* Open or closed - Open models allow you to run them on your own hardware whereas closed models can be easier to setup but * require an API call to get embeddings.\n",
    "* \n",
    "#### Where should I store my embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've got a relatively small dataset, for example, under 100,000 examples (this number is rough and only based on first hand experience), np.array or torch.tensor can work just fine as your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you've got a production system and want to work with 100,000+ embeddings, you may want to look into a vector database (these have become very popular lately and there are many offerings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Ingestion and Embedding Creation Extensions\n",
    "One major extension to the workflow above would to functionize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or turn it into a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in, take all the functionality we've created and package it into a single process (e.g. go from document -> embeddings file).\n",
    "\n",
    "So you could input a document on one end and have embeddings come out the other end. The hardest part of this is knowing what kind of preprocessing your text may need before it's turned into embeddings. Cleaner text generally means better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG - Search and Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieval - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
    "* Augmentation - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to look right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that looks like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
    "* Generation - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
    "* \n",
    "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you were an insurance company with large chains of claims emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use RAG to answer questions about the emails with sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful analogy is to think of LLMs as calculators for words.\n",
    "\n",
    "With good inputs, the LLM can sort them into helpful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How?\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with better search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarity search\n",
    "Similarity search or semantic search or vector search is the idea of searching on vibe.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds like woo, woo. It's not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps searching via meaning is a better analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "With keyword search, you are trying to match the string \"apple\" with the string \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas with similarity/semantic search, you may want to search \"macronutrients functions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And get back results that don't necessarily contain the words \"macronutrients functions\" but get back pieces of text that match that meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using similarity search on our textbook data with the query \"macronutrients function\" returns a paragraph that starts with:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "as the first result. How cool!"
